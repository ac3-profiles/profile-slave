# Profiles-Slave
Profiles-Slave is the slave file for Profiles. The main site uses the 
"slaves" to connect to Mojang's servers, and then the main site caches 
the response. Allowing you to get past any havoc that the main Mojang 
site on it's own would present.
### How do I use it?
You need the following to install the slave: * PHP! * cURL. * PHP's cURL 
extension. * A functioning webserver. These usually include the above.
### Installation
There's many a way. Easiest; copy the contents of "slave.php" and put it 
in a new file on your webserver. If you've installed this, make sure you 
add it to your list of servers!
